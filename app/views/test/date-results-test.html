        <p>Some businesses choose to pay their own sick pay. If you offer sick pay you can decide when to start and stop paying it, and how much to pay. You can pay it from the first day your employee is sick.</p>

        <p>Some businesses also choose to pay additional sick pay. If you offer extra sick pay you can decide when to start and stop paying it, and how much extra to pay. You can pay it from the first day your employee is sick.</p>

        <p>Your employee does not need to give you proof of their sickness, such as a fit note from their doctor. To get SSP, your employee must complete the <a href="https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/PersonalTax_iForms/1.0/SC2&template=SC2.xdp">Employee’s statement of sickness (SC2)</a>.</p>
