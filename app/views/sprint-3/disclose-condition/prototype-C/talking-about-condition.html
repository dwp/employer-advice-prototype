    <p class="govuk-body">It’s important to talk to {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} as early as you can</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There’s no perfect way to do it, but it is important to be open to suggestions and let {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} tell you what would help. Start with how {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} is generally, then move on to work.</p>
       
    <p class="govuk-body">You can ask things like:</p>
    
    <!--
         How is their condition affecting them?
    -->
      
    <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">How is their condition affecting them?</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">The first step is to talk about how then condition affects them. Physical conditions can affect people in many different ways.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Examples of how a physical condition might affect someone include: </p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>if they can get to work, such as if driving is difficult</li>
      <li>how they can do their job, if sitting for a long time is harder</li>
      <li>the kind of work they can do, if lifting or carrying causes pain</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
         Will they stay at work or take sick leave?
    -->
      
    <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Will they stay at work or take sick leave?</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">Staying at work can be good for many people, sometimes with changes to their job. Others will need to take time off.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can ask {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} if they think they would benefit from staying at work, or if they need some sick leave at first.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need advice, you can get help from an occupational health expert. They can help your business to maintain a healthy workforce.</p>

    <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Are there any changes at work that would help?</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">Changes could be needed to help {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} stay at work. Things like reduced hours, different shifts or avoiding some duties can help.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should ask {{ data['employeeName']|default('your employee', true) }} about changes that would help them. You can make suggestions, but it’s important to let them take the lead.</p>
