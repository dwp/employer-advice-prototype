          <p class="govuk-body">An employee found their desk chair very uncomfortable. They mentioned several times in team meetings that their back was hurting.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">After a couple of weeks they told their employer that they had been suffering from a bad back for over month.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">The employee found a new desk chair online that would look great in their room at home, but it was very expensive. They asked their manager for the cost of the chair to be expensed.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">The company couldn't afford the cost of chair and they were worried that it wouldn't meet the Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessment requirements. </p>
     
          <p class="govuk-body"> The employer was worried that the DSE assessment had been missed when the employee first joined the company.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">The manager and employee met to discuss options.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">The employer needed to know if:</p>
   
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>another suitable chair was available to use at home</li>
            <li>the employee carry out the DSE assessment when they first joined the company</li>
            <li>they have been advised by a medical professional to get new equipment</li>
          </ul>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">It was agreed that a DSE assessment would be carried out. The employer could now see that their employees chair was not suitable for long periods of working.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">A new chair was supplied that that suits their needs and was within the company allocated budget allowance.</p>
   
          <p class="govuk-body">They agreed to meet in a months time to check if the pain had improved and to discuss if any next steps were needed.</p>
