      <p class="govuk-body-l">Identify changes that might help your employee by working through the areas below. Consider each one together with your employee.

      <br />
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Ways of working</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Changes to hours, shift patterns or other policies can help your employee do their best at work.</p>
      <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>if depression can make it difficult for someone to start their day, allow them to come in later.</em></p>
      <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>for someone with migraines, more regular screen breaks might help.</em></p>
      <br />
        <hr />
   <br />
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Work environment</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This might include things like desk space, equipment and noise levels. These changes can make the work environment less challenging.</p>
      <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>a place to work away from distractions can help someone who is feeling overwhelmed by stress.</em></p>
      <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>someone who uses mobility aids might need an accessible parking space.</em></p>
      <br />
        <hr />

    <br />
   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Extra help</h2>
   <p class="govuk-body">It might help your employee to have someone to help with parts of their job or how they access work.</p>
   <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>if your employee is returning to work, a buddy system could help them feel supported.</em></p>
   <p class="govuk-hint"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>for someone with temporary hearing loss, give their phone responsibilities to someone else.</em></p>

    <div class="govuk-details__text">
      <p class="govuk-body">An employee found their desk chair very uncomfortable. They mentioned several times in team meetings that their back was hurting.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">After a couple of weeks they told their employer that they had been suffering from a bad back for over month.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The employee found a new desk chair online that would look great in their room at home, but it was very expensive. They asked their manager for the cost of the chair to be expensed.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The company couldn't afford the cost of chair and they were worried that it wouldn't meet the Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessment requirements. </p>
 
      <p class="govuk-body"> The employer was worried that the DSE assessment had been missed when the employee first joined the company.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The manager and employee met to discuss options.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The employer needed to know if:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>another suitable chair was available to use at home</li>
        <li>the employee carry out the DSE assessment when they first joined the company</li>
        <li>they have been advised by a medical professional to get new equipment</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">It was agreed that a DSE assessment would be carried out. The employer could now see that their employees chair was not suitable for long periods of working.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A new chair was supplied that that suits their needs and was within the company allocated budget allowance.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">They agreed to meet in a months time to check if the pain had improved and to discuss if any next steps were needed.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You should review any changes you make regularly. Changes are sometimes temporary and health conditions can change over time.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Decide together when you will meet again and how often will work for you both.</p>
