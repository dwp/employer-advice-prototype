      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The law on making changes</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">By law, you must make changes if you could be expected to know that your employee is disabled. These are called 'reasonable adjustments'. You would be discriminating against them if you did not make reasonable adjustments.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The law defines disability as something physical or mental which has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ effect on someone’s ability to do normal daily activities.</p>
