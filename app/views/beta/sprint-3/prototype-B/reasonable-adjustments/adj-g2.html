      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Discuss possible changes together</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should ask your employee which changes at work might help them. You can make suggestions, but it is important to listen and let them take the lead.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Talk to your employee about possible changes such as:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>changes to the workplace, or anywhere they work</li>
          <li>different ways of working</li>
          <li>giving them extra support</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">These changes are called reasonable adjustments. This means you should make any changes if they are reasonable and affordable for your business.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers">More about reasonable adjustments on GOV.UK</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Help with reasonable adjustments</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Help with costs might be available if you cannot make the changes your employee needs.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a> is a free government service where your employee can apply for help with the costs of changes. They can also provide a workplace assessment to decide which changes are needed.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">If your employee is disabled</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The law says that you must make reasonable adjustments if your employee is a disabled person. You must take care not to discriminate against them.</p>
