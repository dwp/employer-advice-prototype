      <p class="govuk-body">You should ask your employee about any health condition or disability they have. Start with a general chat about how they are and how any condition might affect them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Since your employee is currently at work, starting a conversation gives you the best chance to support them. You may be able to reduce the chances that they will need to go off work.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you talk to your employee about their health condition or disability, make sure you consider their dignity and privacy. Their personal information should be handled confidentially.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Not all employees who meet the definition of disability may think of themselves as a ‘disabled person’. Even if your employee has not disclosed that they have a disability you should consider any circumstances which suggest that they may be disabled and need support. </p>
