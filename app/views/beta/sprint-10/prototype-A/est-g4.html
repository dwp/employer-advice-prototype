      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Learn more about your employee’s disability or health condition</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">You do not need to know the details of your employee’s disability or health condition before you talk to them. However, knowing more can help you prepare for your conversation.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You should be ready to listen to your employee and not make assumptions. You do not need to be an expert in their disability or health condition.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/" target="_blank">NHS Health A to Z (opens in a new tab)</a> has details of many conditions and the most common symptoms. Many of the health conditions listed on the NHS website also have links to support organisations for that condition.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Consider mental health</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Physical conditions can also affect mental health. They can cause stress, anxiety and affect everyday life.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="https://www.mentalhealthatwork.org.uk/" target="_blank">Mind Mental Health at Work (opens in a new tab)</a> website is a collection of work-related guides from mental health experts.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If your employee is disabled or has a long-term health condition</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must not discriminate unlawfully on the grounds of a health condition or disability. When you agree next steps with your employee, keep in mind that the law requires you to make reasonable adjustments in some cases.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should seek advice if you and your employee are not sure if this disability law applies in your situation.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">ACAS has <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/disability-discrimination/what-disability-means" target="_blank">advice on what disability means (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>
