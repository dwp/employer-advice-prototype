      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to say to your employee</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before your conversation, you should check any workplace policy you may have on absence management.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">Let your employee know you support them but only talk to them about work when they are ready.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use encouraging and supporting language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Would you be comfortable...”</li>
        <li>“Let us know...”</li>
        <li>“Can we arrange...”</li>

          What not to say
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What not to say</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Try not to put pressure on your employee. Focus on the support they might need. If they have a long-term condition or disability, take care to ask if their absence is related and what that means for them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should not use forceful language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Have you done this task?”</li>
        <li>“When will things be back to normal?”</li>
        <li>“We need to get you back as quickly as possible”</li>
      </ul>

          How to stay in touch

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to stay in touch</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are no rules about how often you get in touch, although you should consider whether you have a workplace policy,or any sickness absence procedures. You and your employee should agree how often you will contact each other.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use whatever method feels most appropriate for you both. For example, it could be an email, phone call or text message.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of when you’ve been in touch and what you discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Keeping information private</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of when you’ve been in touch and what you discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do. Remember that you must keep these notes private.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can get help with your policies and procedures, free of charge from:</p>
