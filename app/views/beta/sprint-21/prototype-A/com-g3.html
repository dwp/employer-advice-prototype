      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Starting a conversation</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">It's OK to make the first move and start a conversation. Some people might be reluctant to bring things up themselves. Let your employee know you support them, and give them time if they need it.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>let them know you understand that the job or workplace might need changes</li>
        <li>be patient and let the conversation develop gradually</li>
        <li>listen to the words they prefer to use and use those words yourself</li>
      </ul>

      <!--
          What not to say
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Things to keep in mind</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Listen and be open to what your employee says. They will not want to be patronised or treated too differently, but it's OK to take some steps to support their unique needs.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should avoid:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>making assumptions about how their condition might affect them</li>
        <li>using words like 'suffering from' which suggests they are a victim</li>
        <li>assuming they will definitely need your help (it's OK if they decline, but remember to check again later)</li>
      </ul>

          How to stay in touch
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Talk regularly</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Many conditions will change over time, so it's important to talk regularly and make sure any support is still working.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are no rules about how often you meet or talk with your employee about their needs. You should agree how often you will do this together.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Make a note of when youâ€™ve spoken and what you discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Keep health information private. If you need to share it with colleagues, get your employee's consent first.</p>
