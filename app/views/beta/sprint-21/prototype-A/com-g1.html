      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to say to your employee</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Let your employee know you support them. You should only talk to them about work when they are ready.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You could say:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>"take some time to look after yourself"</li>
        <li>"let us know if there is anything you need"</li>
        <li>"can we arrange a time to talk about work and agree next steps?"</li>
      </ul>

      <!--
          What not to say
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What not to say</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Try not to put pressure on your employee. Focus on the support they might need. If they have a disability or long-term condition, take care to ask if their absence is related and what that means for them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should not say:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>"have you done this task?"</li>
        <li>"when will things be back to normal?"</li>
        <li>"we need to get you back as quickly as possible"</li>
      </ul>

          How to stay in touch
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to stay in touch</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are no rules about how often you get in touch. You and your employee should agree how often you will contact each other.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use whatever method feels most appropriate for you both. For example, it could be an email, phone call or text message.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of when youâ€™ve been in touch and what you discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do.</p>
