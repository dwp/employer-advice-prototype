      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Ask your employee what changes they need </h1>
     
      <p class="govuk-body-l">Your employee’s disability or health condition might mean they need some changes to their role or workplace.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to talk to your employee about what they need</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Many disabled people and people with health conditions want to continue working. Work brings more than just financial benefits – it also gives many people a sense of purpose and community.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Ask your employee what changes they need to their job, workplace or ways of working. It’s natural to focus on what might be more difficult for them, but remember to talk about what they feel capable of doing.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Let your employee lead</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can be proactive and start an open conversation, but let your employee lead where they can. They might be more comfortable taking some time to think and coming back to the conversation later.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you need to prompt them, use open-ended questions like:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is there anything in the workplace that is making things more challenging for you?</li>
        <li>what can we change to help in the short and long term? Are things likely to change over time?</li>
        <li>are you worried about any specific part of your job? How can we help with that?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Once you know what challenges your employee faces, you can discuss the changes that could help them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of what you have discussed with your employee. This can be a helpful reminder of what you need to do.</p>
