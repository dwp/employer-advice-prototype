      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">What to do if your employee has not told you about a disability or health condition</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">It can be helpful for you to know why your employee is off work, but they do not have to tell you.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">It's important to create a culture where employees are happy to talk about about their health.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Avoid judgements when you talk about disabilities or health conditions. This is especially important for mental health conditions.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Explain that you will keep health information private, and only use it to make changes to help them do their job.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When you can ask for medical evidence</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can ask for medical evidence if your employee is off work for 8 days or more. Examples of medical evidence are a letter from a hospital or a fit note from a doctor.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A fit note will have a summary of the disability or health condition and a recommendation about your employee’s ability to work.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If your employee does not give you medical evidence after 8 days’ absence you do not have to pay Statutory Sick Pay.</p>
