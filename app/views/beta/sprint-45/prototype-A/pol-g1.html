      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Policies and procedures for your business</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">The types of policies and procedures you have in place will depend on the size and function of your business. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The law</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">There are three policies that businesses are required to have. These are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Disciplinary and dismissal</li>
        <li>Grievance</li>
        <li>Health and safety (if you have more than five employees)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">As a minimum, to protect the business and your employees, you should also consider having the following policies:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Equality, diversity and inclusion</li>
        <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which covers the management and processing of personal data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Benefits of implementing policies and procedures</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">There can be several benefits to having workplace policies in place, including: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>better employee retention </li>
        <li>employees know what is expected of them </li>
        <li>increased employee productivity </li>
        <li>Increased employee morale </li>
        <li>protection from issues that could result in failure of employment legislation </li>
      </ul> 

      <p class="govuk-body">Having policies in place could help you in managing a complaint relating to disability discrimination or disability victimisation. You should also seek guidance from a legal professional if needed.</p>
