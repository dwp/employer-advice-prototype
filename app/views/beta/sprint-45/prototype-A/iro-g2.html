      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Guidance on recruiting and onboarding in an inclusive way</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">It’s important that you recruit and onboard employees in an inclusive and accessible way. Every health condition and disability is individual and can change over time. Communicating often with your applicants and employees can help to make sure their needs are met.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to recruit in an inclusive way</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/recruitment-disabled-people" target="_blank">Check the guidance on encouraging applications from people with disabilties on GOV.UK. (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can research courses to improve your company’s inclusive recruitment and hiring practices. <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/training/how-do-accessible-inclusive-recruitment" target="_blank">AbilityNet offer a course on accessible, inclusive recruitment (opens in new tab)</a>. It includes how to post job openings and interview candidates.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/disability-confident-campaign" target="_blank">You can find information about how to become a Disability Confident employer on GOV.UK. (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Wording job adverts</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">To make your job adverts more inclusive and accessible you should:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>make the wording clear and concise</li>
        <li>list specific role requirements</li>
        <li>avoid wording like “cultural-fit”</li>
        <li>remove biased language</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You could have more than one way for applicants to apply for roles - online or submitting a verbal application. This could make the application process more accessible.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/membership/members/" target="_blank">Checking how Business Disability Forum members word their own job adverts could help you when advertising for your roles. (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Interviewing inclusively</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Interviews can be stressful for some applicants. Remember that not all health conditions and disabilities are visual.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Following some of these tips could help:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>let the applicant know as many details about the interview as possible – location and access (if in person), duration, platforms required (if a video interview)</li>
        <li>check the applicant is comfortable and understands the interview process</li>
        <li>do not make assumptions about applicants, focus on their skills and experience to do the role</li>
        <li>provide the questions in advance of the interview</li>
        <li>reduce the size of the interview panel to help to lower anxiety</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Onboarding inclusively</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">It’s important to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/recruitment-disabled-people/reasonable-adjustments" target="_blank">discuss any reasonable adjustments (opens in new tab)</a> that an employee could need to carry out their role effectively and safely.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If a phased start to work could be an option, discuss this with your employee during the selection stage. You could also consider flexible or part-time working arrangements.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Consider having a buddy system in place for new starters. This can help them to feel more supported.</p>
