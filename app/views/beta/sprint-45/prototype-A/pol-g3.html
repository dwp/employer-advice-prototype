      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Preparing policy and procedure documents</h1>
    
      <p class="govuk-body">There are several ways that you can prepare the documents for your business. These include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>creating them yourself from scratch </li>
        <li>creating them yourself from a set template</li>
        <li>using the services of a third party such as an HR or legal company</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">There will be pros and cons to each of these options. You will have to decide which is best for your business.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/templates-for-employers" target="_blank">adapt these templates from Acas.org.uk (opens in new tab)</a> for your business.  </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Supplying accessible policies</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">Policies should be accessible to all employees. Supplying them in different formats could help employees with certain health conditions or disabilities. Consider having a printed, digital or easy-read version. Remember to update all formats when adding any changes in legislation or when there are changes to your procedures.</p>      

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make the wording of any policies or procedure documents clear and concise.</p> 
          
      <p class="govuk-body">You could consider supplying policies to new employees before their start date. This will give them an idea of the company processes. It could save time in their first week if they have done mandatory reading before their start date.</p>      
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Addressing capability concerns</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before addressing any concerns, you should understand what is and is not a disability. <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/check-if-youre-protected-from-discrimination/what-counts-as-disability/" target="_blank">You can read an explanation of the definition in the Equality Act 2010 on the Citizens Advice website (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you have capability concerns about an employee and identify a health condition or disability could be the possible cause, you should <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/capability-procedures" target="_blank">check the guidance on the Acas website (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
