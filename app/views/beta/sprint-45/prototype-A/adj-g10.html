      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Keep talking with your employee</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Talk regularly to your employee about what they need. The changes you put in place now might not always be right for them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some conditions will vary over the long term, and others will have good and bad days. Try to accommodate this kind of change.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should keep a record of the changes or reasonable adjustments you have agreed. Review it together regularly.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A reasonable adjustment plan is useful for this. <a href="https://businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/knowledge-hub/resources/tailored-adjustments-plans-passports-and-agreements/" target="_blank">The Business Disability Forum (opens in new tab)</a> has guidance on reasonable adjustment plans.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The changes you put in place should support your employee as much as possible. If the situation has changed, you can get useful advice from an occupational health provider. These services are paid for but can help your business by keeping your employees healthy and productive.</p>
