      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">About inclusive recruiting and onboarding</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">Applicants are protected under the Equality Act 2010. You should hire the best person for the job based on their application and interview.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Avoiding discrimination</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You must avoid disability discrimination during the recruitment and selection process. You can ask applicants if they need any reasonable adjustments. But you must not ask about health conditions or disabilities until a job offer has been accepted.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/recruitment-disabled-people/reasonable-adjustments" target="_blank">You can read more about reasonable adjustments on GOV.UK (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance" target="_blank">Read more about the Equality Act 2010 on GOV.UK. (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Benefits of inclusive recruitment</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Employing people with health conditions and disabilities can help you to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>have access to a wider group of applicants</li>
        <li>have a more diverse workforce</li>
        <li>improve existing employee morale</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Sickness absences can also be reduced as there will be more open working culture and adjustments can be put in place if needed.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Retaining employees will remove the cost of recruiting, advertising and interviewing for roles.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/disability-confident-campaign" target="_blank">Employers can sign up for the Disability Confident scheme (opens in new tab)</a>. They can then use the Disability Confident symbol in their job adverts. This will show that they encourage applications from people with disabilities.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You could encourage more applicants if you display that you are an equal opportunities employer. This is also known as an equal employment opportunity (EEO) statement.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.eoc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Find out more about being an equal opportunities employer on the EOC website (opens in new tab)</a></p>
