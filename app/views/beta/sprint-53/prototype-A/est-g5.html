      <p class="govuk-body-l">Your employee does not have to give you details of their condition, but there are some things you can do to help.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Reassure your employee</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">Explain that you will keep health information private, and only use it to make changes to help your employee do their job.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Avoid judgements when you talk about health conditions or disabilities. This is especially important for mental health conditions.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Do not put pressure on your employee to return to work quickly. Come back to the conversation later if they are not ready to talk.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Company culture</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">It's important to create a culture where employees are happy to talk about about their health. Treating each employee with care will help to create this culture over time.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/disability-confident-how-to-sign-up-to-the-employer-scheme" target="_blank">The Disability Confident scheme (opens in a new tab)</a> can help you become more comfortable with employing and managing people with long-term health conditions and disabilities. </p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/disability/best-practice/workplace-culture.htm" target="_blank">Find more best practice guidance on creating a supportive and enabling workplace on the HSE website (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Medical evidence and sick pay</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can choose to ask for medical evidence of your employee’s condition if they have been off work for 8 days or more. Examples of medical evidence include a letter from a hospital, or a fit note.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fit-note-guidance-for-employers-and-line-managers" target="_blank">Check more guidance on fit notes (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You would not have to pay Statutory Sick Pay if they do not provide this evidence.</p>

     <!--
          If employee is off 197 days or more
      -->

      {% if (data['daysEmployeeOffSick'] >= '197') %}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If your employee has been off for more than 28 weeks</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) stops being paid to employees after this time.</p>
